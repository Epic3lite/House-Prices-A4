# House-Prices-A4
Machine Learning algorithm for House Prices

## Week 7 TODO

Prepare a Data Exploratory Analysis. Take help from existing Kernels on Kaggle. Do the following tasks and code in python.
 - Understand how variables are distributed and how they interact [done]
 - Apply different transformations before training machine learning models [done]
 - Covers both univariate and multivariate approaches [???]
 - Includes visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn [done]
 - Start basic data visualization such as histogram, scatter plot, box plot, correlation, and bar plot. [done]
 - Read about linear regression models. [done]

## Week 9 TODO
 - Learn to use visualization techniques to study missing data and distributions
 - Covers both continuous and categorical data (help: https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/house-prices-eda) [done]
 - Includes correlation heatmaps, pairplots, and t-SNE to help inform appropriate inputs to a linear model [done]
 - Learn about feature selection using common methods such as filter and wrapper. There is no specific algorithm for you. Feel free to use any method, which suits better to your aim and objectives. 
 - Start learning about linear regression. Itâ€™s a high time to start learning training data. [done]

## Week 16 TODO
 - Use a linear regression model to predict SalesPrice [done]
 - Use better filtering methods on the training data to get a better score on kaggle [done]

## Week 18 TODO
 - Get to rank 1000 on the leaderboard
 - Read more kernels to improve the model
